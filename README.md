# CSGO_Analysis
A small ML project on Video game Analysis and it is project that was fun to work with

The Dataset was not given as the file very big even after compressing so i will be giving a kaggle link to the whole notebook and you can download the dataset from there

Just the datasets are needed and then jupter, google colab,data spell, kaggle notebook can be used to run this and just change the paths for all the data reading process and install necessary packages also
